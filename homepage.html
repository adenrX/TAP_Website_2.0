        <h1 class="TAPinfoHeader">Who are we?</h1>
        <h2 class="TAPinfo">TAP also known as the Technology Advantage Program is a 6 year program that starts in grade nine but 
                            students would apply and have to do an interview back in grade 8 to be accepted. TAP focuses on teaching 
                            students with technology skills, whether those are Coding, or building computers. Or put simply, just Teaching 
                            students using technology that they haven't used prior to the program. But since high school is only 4 years, they 
                            also spend their High School years gaining the necessary credits to get into 1 out of 4 programs that are pre-paid 
                            for them, we will go over those 4 programs later. The TAP class program is only in 3 places in Nova Scotia.</h2>

        <h1 class="TAPinfoHeader1">How is TAP different from other programs?</h1>
        <h2 class="TAPinfo1">Like the pre-aforementioned free college, we get benefits that other programs don't. Our Class has the most usage of technology, 
                            and our main form of learning is by using technology, another form of learning we use is project based learning. Project based learning 
                            is well in the title. We do a lot more group work then other classes as well. And before covid we used to go on a lot of field trips as 
                            part of the learning experience.</h2>
        
        <h1 class="TAPinfoHeader1">Free college? Tell me more</h1>
        <h2 class="TAPinfo1">Students in TAP once they finish 4 years at high school they can choose 1 out of 4 programs to take at NSCC, they are known by the TAP 
                            students as The 4 Strands. The 4 Strands are made up by, IT Database Administration, IT Data Analytics, IT Website Development, and IT Programming. 
                            To learn more about TAP 4 Strands go to the 4 Strands page.</h2>
