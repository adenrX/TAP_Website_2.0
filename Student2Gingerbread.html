    <h1>Xander Doucette</h1>
    <h2>
        The date is December 16th, 2005. I was born to my mother and father on a snowy day. I was the first born out of 2, the other being my brother Ethan 3 years later on August 1st 2008. I was mostly raised by my mother nonetheless.
        <br /> <br />
        My hobbies at the time were playing soccer, playing video games, art and writing stories. As a kid I wanted to code my own games because I was very creative and had a lot of great ideas, and I wasn't really allowed to play games then even then I was limited. Now-a-days i have less restrictions and my hobbies are playing and making Video games. My favorite game is Minecraft, I grew up playing it basically. I also enjoy coding and designing websites
        <br /><br />
        For education I went to Meadowfields for P - 6, Maple Grove 7-8, and now YCMHS and the plan for college is to move to Ottawa for a 3 year program in Animation and Game Development.
        <br /><br />
        My one goal in life is still the same as it was as a kid, to become a Videogame Developer and eventually have my own company to develop games, because I have even more ideas that I will make them become reality.
